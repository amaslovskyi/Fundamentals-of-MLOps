# Health Claims Fraud Detection Project

This project involves building a Flask web application that uses an Isolation Forest model to detect potentially fraudulent health claims. It leverages BentoML for model serving and MLflow for experiment tracking.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

- Load the bash profile and set up the virtual environment:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. BentoML and Model Management

- List BentoML models:

```bash
bentoml models list
```

- Run the synthetic data generator script:

```bash
python3 synthetic_health_claims.py
```

- Train and evaluate the Isolation Forest model:

```bash
python3 isolation_model.py
```

### 3. MLflow for Experiment Tracking

- Start the MLflow UI to track experiments:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

### 4. Run the Flask Web Application

- Open a new terminal window, source the environment, and run the Flask app:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
source venv/bin/activate
python3 flask_app.py
```

### 5. Register Model and Serve with BentoML

- In another terminal, run the following commands to register and serve the model with BentoML:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
source venv/bin/activate
python3 isolation_model.py
python3 register_model.py
bentoml serve service.py --reload
```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that all commands are executed in the correct order for proper setup and functioning of the application.
- Use BentoML to serve models and integrate them with the Flask app for real-time fraud detection.
- The MLflow UI helps to track experiments and evaluate model performance.
